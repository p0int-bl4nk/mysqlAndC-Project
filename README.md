Book record
I wrote this code to learn connecting MySQL and c.
This code can --
* Create a database (db1) and a table(library) in mysql
* Insert data (book id, title, author and no.of pages)
* Edit record
* Delete record
* Search record
* Display all records, and
* Shutdown server

I wrote and compiled this code on Termux, Android 10, Clang 11.1
